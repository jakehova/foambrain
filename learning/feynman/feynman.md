# Feynman Technique

* Pretend to teach a concept you want to learn about to a student in the sixth grade.
    * Write the subject at the top of the page
    * Write out everything you know about the topic as if explaining it to a child (focus on short attention span and no-special-term vocabulary)
* Identify gaps in your explanation. Go back to the source material to better understand it.
* Organize and simplify.
* Transmit (optional).
