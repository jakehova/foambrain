**ASA**
* Contains Immutable and Mutable properties
  * Immutable: 
    * Creator - auto populated by the sender of the initial creation transaction
    * Total - # of units available for the ASA
    * Decimals - How many places can each unit be subdivided
    * DefaultFrozen - Can the ASA be traded by default (false if it can be traded immediately)
    * AssetName (o) - 32 byte string to name the asset class (ie if it was a coin then Bitcoin)
    * UnitName (o) - 8 byte string name of the unit of the asset (ie if it was a coin then BTC)
    * URL (o) - 32 byte string that allows a URL to be appended to the asset to specify a location off-chain
    * MetaDataHash (o) - 32 byte field to store hash of the off-chain data
  * Mutable:
    * ManagerAddress - Account that has the ability to change the other addresses
    * ReserveAddress - Account that can be used to hold logical unminted tokens
    * FreezeAddress - Account that can Freeze or Unfreeze the ASA
    * ClawbackAddress - Account that can take the asset from an address and given to another.

      * Any of these addresses can be locked by making them empty.  When making it empty, it is permanent!
