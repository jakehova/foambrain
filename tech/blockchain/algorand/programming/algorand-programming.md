**Errors**
* Get an error saying "bad request" 400 error when sending raw transaction
    * Issue could be that local node is out of sync and you need to run a catchup
      * Get the latest catchpoint: 
        * BetaNet https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/betanet/latest.catchpoint
        * TestNet https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/testnet/latest.catchpoint
        * MainNet https://algorand-catchpoints.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/channel/mainnet/latest.catchpoint
      * Take the result of that catchpoint and run the catchup
        * ./goal node catchup <catchup value from previous step> -d <path to data directory>
