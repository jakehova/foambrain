# Algorand Smart Contracts

- [[algorand-stateful-contract]] - Stateful Contract
- [[algorand-stateless-contract]] - Stateless Contract

**What**
* Smart Contracts are small programs that operate on layer-1
* Two main categories are stateful and stateless
* Written in Transaction Execution Approval Language (TEAL - https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asc1/teal/)
  *  Can be written by hand OR in Python using PyTEAL library (https://developer.algorand.org/docs/features/asc1/teal/pyteal/)
  *  Interpreted by each algorand node 
*  Smart contracts have access to: 
   *  arguments
   *  global variables
   *  balances
   *  Algorand ASAs
   *  grouped transaction properties
*  [Examples](https://github.com/algorand/smart-contracts/tree/master/devrel/demo)

**Differences between Stateless and Stateful Contracts**
| Metric | Stateful | Stateless |
| ---    | ---      | ---       |
| Evaluation | Block Assembly | Tx Submission | 
| Size | 1kb | 1000 bytes |
| OpCodes* | 700/Program | 20000 |
| Access to Ledger | Facilitates Assets/Account Lookups | Only Tx Based Values | 
| Track State Values | Yes | No |
| Logic | Lives on Chain | Submitted with Tx(s) |
| Templates | Not avail | Yes (HTLC, Split, etc) |
*OpCodes - There is a budget for every contract.  OpCode cost is a numeric value that measures how much computing power a specific operator is going to use.  Most are 1 but some are quite expensive
