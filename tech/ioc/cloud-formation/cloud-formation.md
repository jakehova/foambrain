Feynman: 
1) Identify: 
* What do I want to learn? 
    * I want to learn about cloud formation
* Everything I know about it: 
    * I know that cloud formation is an aws technology that is used to deploy infrastructure in the cloud.  Scripts for cloud formation are written in YAML or JSON. Not all services are supported by CF ([AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-template-resource-type-ref.html))
* Topics to learn:
    * How do you handle services that are not supported by CF  
    * How are scripts organized inside of AWS (stacks?)
    * How to execute a script - Go to cloud formation in aws console and upload file, enter parameters, and execute
    * How to remove a deployment
    * How to update a deployment
    * How to pass in parameters to make the script dynamic - leverage parameters section
    * How to maintain scripts
    * How to troubleshoot scripts
2) ELI5 - Explanation for 5 year old (write down everything you know about your topic, but this time, pretend you are explaining it to a child.)
3) Reflect & Study (Evaluate results of step 2: How well were you able to explain it? Where did you get frustrated? Where did you resort to jargon?) 
4) Organize, Convey, Review (Organize the results into a compelling story (story-botish))
