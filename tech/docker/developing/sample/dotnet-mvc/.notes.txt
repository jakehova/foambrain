* created a dotnet core mvc project; dotnet new mvc
* used a .net core docker image: docker pull mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk
* updated launchsettings to allow any ip along port 5000: "applicationUrl": "http://+:5000"
* generate container in interactive mode: docker run -it -p 8080:5000  -v ${pwd}:/app -w "/app" mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/core/sdk /bin/bash
* ran dotnet build
* ran dotnet watch run
